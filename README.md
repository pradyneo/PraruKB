# PraruKB
PraruKB is a customized English keyboard mainly targeted for the Indian users. The keyboard is still under development and this is the first patch of code that I have uploaded. It is still in beta and is not production-ready yet. The main features of this keyboard are -
1. It has a dedicated Indian Rupee Symbol in the main keypad itself.
2. A revamped numpad for ease of typing using both hands.
